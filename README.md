- ðŸ‘‹  Hi, Iâ€™m Jack Kilkenny (@JKilkenny4)
- I'm a data nerd located in Philadelphia interested in data science and machine learning. My background is in experimental psychology, market research, and statistical theory, but I'm constantly looking for new things to learn
- Experience coding / working in R, Python, SQL, and SPSS
- Looking to collaborate on just about anything, but I've recently become interested in exploring unsupervised and reinforcement learning models
- Feel free to shoot me an email at Jackkilkenny225@gmail.com if you ever want to get in touch with me (either about a project you want to collaborate on, some thoughts you have on a project I've uploaded here, or even just to chat)
