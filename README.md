- 👋 Hi, I’m Jack Kilkenny (@JKilkenny4)
- 👀 I'm primarily interested in data science and machine learning, and I have a background in experimental psychology, market research, and statistical theory
- 🌱 I have experience coding in both R and Python, and I'm currently working on becoming more proficient at SQL
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on just about anything, but I've recenelty become interested in exploring unsupervised learning models
- 📫 Feel free to shoot me an email at Jackkilkenny225@gmail.com if you ever want to get in touch with me (either about a project you want to collaborate on, some thoughts you have on a project I've uploaded here, or even just to chat)
